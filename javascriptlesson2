JavaScript Arrow function Format:

const yourFn = () => {
...
}

Implicitly returning:

const implicit = () => "A STRING"

You cannot return another object this way, this only works to return one string


IIFE:

(function myIIFE(num) {
  return num * num
}) (5)

Function is called with argument of 5 immediately after defining it. The below is also doing the same thing, calling the function with an argument of 5 right after declaring the anonymous function/

((num) => num * num)(5)

The first part is an anonymous functino being defined, then it is immediately called with an argument of 5.

Reduce function:

array.reduce(function(param, meters)) {
  ......
}

This will go through the array from front to back and perform the function on each element of the array
